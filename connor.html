                <p>
                    I was born in a small town called Brooks, two hours east of Calgary. 
                    I lived with my parents and younger brother who is currently 16 years old. 
                    I have one pet, a very loud husky, she’s beautiful but very very loud, she's currently 11 years old. 
                    I graduated high school just last year, I was not top of my class. 
                    After I graduated I needed more money to make Vancouver Film School achievable, so I started working on the services rigs. 
                    All I can say about working in the southern Alberta oil patch is that it isn’t for the faint of heart. 
                    There was a lot of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior that wouldn’t fly at VFS. 
                    I’m so excited to be at VFS, programming is my passion and I can’t wait to get into the industry!
