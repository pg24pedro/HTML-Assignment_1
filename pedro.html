                    Hello World! My name is Pedro. I was born in Mexico City on February the 4th, 1998. Back in Mexico, 
                    I lived with my parents and my sister, who is currently 20 years old. 
                    I have one pet, she’s a dachshund dog named Mia and I had another dachshund called Slinky who recently passed away. 
                    I studied audio engineering at Tec de Monterrey, State of Mexico Campus and graduated Cum Laude back in 2020 during the pandemic. 
                    After graduating, I worked as a freelance mixing and mastering engineer, composer and session musician (guitarist).  
                    In 2022, I got my first full time job as an audio engineer for the studio Bunker Ganesh, in which I was in charge of recording, editing and directing audiobooks for Penguin Random House Audio. 
                    Now, I’m seeking to improve my engineering skills by becoming a software developer. 
                    I love playing the guitar, listening to music, taking long walks in the city, hanging out with friends and coding!
