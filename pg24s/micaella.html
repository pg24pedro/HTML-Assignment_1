                    I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I lived with my parents, my sister, my brother, and my two dogs. 
                    I create things during my free time, in many different mediums. 
                    My most recent art project was crocheting some leg warmers, because for some reason Winnipeg doesn’t sell any (despite it being so cold there). 
                    I’ve been coding since grade 12, and after graduation I attended the University of Manitoba and majored in Computer Science. 
                    I did not finish because I hated online learning, and went back to high school to attend the post-high Game Design program. 
                    In the post-high program I made games for CBC Kids and worked in a group project for FlipsideXR. 
                    The teachers of that program recommended that I apply to this school and program and I got in, so here I am!
