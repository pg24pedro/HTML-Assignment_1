                    My name is Rafael Zagolin. I am from Brazil and I grew up in a large city called Sao Paulo. 
                    I was originally born in another city named Boa Esperanca, 
                    although my parents went to that city only to take me to Sao Paulo when I was just a cute and little baby. 
                    Yes, I am adopted.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    I have always played video games since I was a little kid, my favorite console back then was playstation 2. 
                    Since I was young I was into computers and would always wonder how softwares got created, 
                    even though I did not have any clue on what was going on, I would try to create a server for this MMORPG game called Perfect World back in 2010.
                </p>
                <p>                      
                    In the year of 2017, I started taking a games design diploma in my hometown, 
                    but then this opportunity of coming to Canada showed up and I dropped out of college. 
                    I came to Canada, took a program called ELF at SAIT in Calgary, Alberta. 
                    By the end of 2018, I went back to Brazil and restarted taking the games design course, but it was in a university, therefore it would get me a bachelor degree. 
                    I graduated on that course by the end of 2022 and during that program I have worked for a few game studios as a game programmer. 
                    I am hoping to continue working as a programmer, but it does not necessarily have to be in the game creation field only, I am open minded about it. 
                    My main interest at the moment is to work as a gameplay programmer, where I can program gameplay systems, AI, mechanics and so on.
