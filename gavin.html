                <p>
                    I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on November 20th, 2003. I have been passionate about coding since grade 10, and since then I have taken almost entirely programming/design courses. 
                    Last year I attended the Sisler Post-High program, where we ended up making games for CBC Kids. 
                    During the program, I applied for, and received a scholarship for VFS. 
                    I practice many different things, such as coding, art, graphic design, & video editing. 
                    I am mostly self taught, but I really enjoy learning from and collaborating with other people. 
                    I am currently working with someone on an Ecommerce site called Onism222 (I designed the site, and some of the upcoming designs), 
                    and I hope to meet many new people and find many new opportunities in VFS!
